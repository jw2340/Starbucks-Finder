# Starbucks Finder

I created this website for my CS50 final project. The website allows users to search for Starbucks cafes in a given area in Japan. 
Users can enter in a city, prefecture, or zipcode. The Starbucks cafes in the area will be shown on a map. Users can click
on each location to write a review about the cafe (outlet availability, general atmosphere, etc). Users can also read reviews
written by others.

A demo can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y9JU2fE8Dg">here</a>.
